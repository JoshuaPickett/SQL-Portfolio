This repository is where I keep all my SQL projects.

About Me:

Experienced Inventory Manager with a demonstrated history of working in the retail sector. Skilled in Sales, Communication, Strategy, Training, and English. Strong operations professional graduated from Morrinsville College. 

I am a hardworking and driven person who is always willing to go the extra mile. My commitment to learning new skills allows me to continuously improve and reach new heights. I am dedicated to finding creative solutions in a timely manner, no matter the task at hand.

Although my responsibilities at Mitre10 have been predominantly retail and customer service, working there has given me experience in numerous administrative and managerial roles. In my seven years at Mitre10, I was often given the responsibility of managing staff and running the store in the Ownersâ€™ absence. I also single-handedly deployed a new till system throughout the store within the time frame given by Head Office. I take pride in my ability to be an excellent resource for all aspects of the business.

My recent experience at LIC has been brief but impactful. LIC gave me the opportunity to move from customer service to administration and data management where I worked with dynamic people who are committed to achieving the very best at their job and inspired me to do the same.
LIC also gave me a chance to expand my knowledgebase outside of the retail sector and learn many new opportunities.

I plan to continue working towards my professional development, contributing what I've learned to all aspects of my career.
